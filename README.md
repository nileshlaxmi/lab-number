# Lab Number
A lab number is a number such that the square of any of its prime divisors is still one of its divisors.

```
For example:
Input: 8
Output: true (2 is a prime divisor of 8, and 2x2=4 is also a divisor of 8)

Input: 50
Output: true (5 is a prime divisor of 50, and 5x5=25 is also a divisor of 50)
